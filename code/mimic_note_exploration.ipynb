Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no\\nsubcutaneous air noted.  Cardiac:  No murmurs, rubs, or\\ngallops.  Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen:  There was a 1.5\\ncm left upper quadrant wound, otherwise diffusely tender.\\nBack:  No step-off.  No deformities.  Nontender.\\nExtremities:  A right above the knee amputation with\\nprosthesis.  Left leg with chronic venostasis changes.\\nRectal:  Good tone.  Contaminated by external blood.\\nNeurological:  No focal deficits.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION:  Chemistries generally normal\\nwith creatinine of 1.2.  Blood gas 7.39/49/341/31/4, lactate\\n2.5, amylase 107, fibrinogen 171.  PT 15.8, PTT 36.1, INR\\n1.7.  His white blood count was 5.1, hematocrit 34.4.  Urine\\ntoxicology was not performed.\\n\\nA chest x-ray was within normal limits, status post left\\nsubclavian line placement which was in place.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room\\nfor wound exploration directly from the Trauma Room.  The\\npatient was taken to the Operating Room, as mentioned above,\\nfor an exploratory laparotomy, extensive lysis of adhesions,\\nand control of rectus and omental bleeding.  The estimated\\nblood loss was approximately 1,000 cc.  Please see the\\noperative note dictated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2199-2-8**] for\\ncomplete report.\\n\\nThe patient was then transferred to the SICU where his\\ncoagulopathy was corrected.  He received 4 units of packed\\nred cells, 4 units of FFP, and 1 cryoprecipitate.\\n\\nWhile on the unit, he was extubated on [**2199-2-10**], SICU\\nday number three and he was noted to have progressive\\nthrombocytopenia.  His home p.o. medications were restarted\\nas well.\\n\\nOn [**2199-2-11**], hospital day number four, the patient\\nwas transferred to the floor.  His diet was advanced and he\\nwas placed on an aggressive bowel regimen to get his bowels\\nmoving postsurgically.  The Pain Service was also consulted\\nbecause of the patient's history of narcotic abuse and his\\ncontinued complaints of pain.  They recommended increasing\\nhis dose of Klonopin and starting MSIR.\\n\\nOn hospital day number five, the patient was noted to have a\\nheparin-induced antibody which may be one of the reasons he\\nwas coagulopathic on admission, although his HIV disease and\\nother drug abuse cannot be ruled out as cause.  His platelet\\ncount remained relatively stable, however, as did his\\nhematocrit.\\n\\nBy hospital day number six, the patient was doing somewhat\\nbetter; however, after being noted to be somewhat sedated,\\nhis Klonopin dose as well as MSIR and methadone were\\ndecreased.  The patient did work with Physical Therapy and\\nwas able to ambulate, hop a bit out of bed.\\n\\nAdditionally, Case Management spoke with the patient's\\nlong-term nurse practitioner, who stated that at baseline he\\nnormally uses a wheelchair and occasionally walks on his\\nprosthesis.  Additionally, the nurse practitioner stated that\\nthe patient does chronically abuse drugs, both prescriptions\\nand illicits, and advised not to give the patient any pain\\nprescriptions upon discharge as he had more than enough at\\nhome.  It was also discussed that the patient would often try\\nto prolong his hospital courses in the past in an attempt to\\nget more narcotics.\\n\\nOn the date of discharge, the patient will be set up with VNA\\nServices for home to change his dressings.  He will also be\\ninstructed to follow-up with his primary care doctor or\\nTrauma Clinic to have the staples removed from his abdominal\\nwound.\\n\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home with services.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Same as on admission.\\n\\nFOLLOW-UP PLANS:  As mentioned above, with the Trauma Clinic\\nand his primary care doctor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                          [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2213**], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 2214**]\\n\\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2215**]\\n\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:  [**2199-2-13**]  11:15\\nT:  [**2199-2-17**]  08:56\\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 2216**]\\n\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Get unique values\n","unique_values = data['category'].unique()\n","print(unique_values)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"XgG2QLNBBRSL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739378292378,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":231,"user":{"displayName":"Jaya Chaturvedi","userId":"16516796067822723301"}},"outputId":"0af7eda1-f7ea-4c43-ffad-76d7d4e38bfa"},"execution_count":34,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["['Discharge summary' 'Echo' 'ECG' 'Nursing' 'Physician ' 'Respiratory '\n"," 'Case Management ' 'Nutrition' 'General' 'Rehab Services' 'Social Work'\n"," 'Radiology' 'Nursing/other' 'Consult' 'Pharmacy']\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from pathlib import Path\n","\n","###init dataset path\n","dataset_dir = Path('/content/gdrive/MyDrive/hackathon/')\n","interim_directory = Path('/content/gdrive/MyDrive/hackathon/Jaya')\n","\n","cvd_df = pd.read_csv(dataset_dir / \"cvd_note.csv\")\n","\n","column_names = cvd_df.columns\n","print(column_names)\n","\n","###Give a placeholder ID for each text\n","cvd_df.columns.values[0] = 'note_ID'\n","\n","print(cvd_df['note_ID'])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"BFsbg1Qb1eyu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739377479189,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":12414,"user":{"displayName":"Jaya Chaturvedi","userId":"16516796067822723301"}},"outputId":"4d9a7eb8-c6ae-460b-f807-7332e726157b"},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Index(['Unnamed: 0', 'row_id', 'subject_id', 'hadm_id', 'seq_num', 'icd9_code',\n","       'row_id.1', 'subject_id.1', 'hadm_id.1', 'chartdate', 'charttime',\n","       'storetime', 'category', 'description', 'cgid', 'iserror', 'text'],\n","      dtype='object')\n","0              0\n","1              1\n","2              2\n","3              3\n","4              4\n","           ...  \n","364074    364074\n","364075    364075\n","364076    364076\n","364077    364077\n","364078    364078\n","Name: note_ID, Length: 364079, dtype: int64\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-18-eb214dab76db>:7: DtypeWarning: Columns (10,11) have mixed types.

A\\nlesion in the left lung was discovered in the upper lobe and a\\nneedle biopsy confirmed non-small cell carcinoma.  He underwent\\na PET scan, which showed extreme hypermetabolism with an SUV of\\n17 at the site of the lung primary lesion.  There is sparse\\nuptake within the mediastinum, not considered of pathologic\\nsignificance, as well as active inflammation around the\\nabdominal graft.\\n\\nHe presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2183-7-23**] for an operation to address his\\nleft non-small cell lung cancer.\\n\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nThe patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on the day of planned surgery.\\nHe was noted to have significant bradycardia prior to starting\\nthe operation.  He did undergo a flexible bronchoscopy and\\nmediastinoscopy that was complicated by substantial\\nintraoperative bleeding.  He was subsequently ruled out for a\\ncardiac event, and remained\\nhemodynamically and neurologically stable on POD#1. On HD#3, the\\ndecision was made to proceed with a segmental resection given\\nthe T2 size of the lesion and his limited baseline lung\\nfunction. Please refer to both operative notes of [**2183-7-23**] and\\n[**2183-7-25**] for further details of the procedures. An epidural was\\nplaced for postoperative pain control on [**2183-7-25**]. Two left-sided\\nchest tubes were placed intraoperatively, and a post-operative\\nchest radiograph showed a moderate left sided pneumothorax.\\n\\nOn [**2183-7-25**], he was transfused 1 unit of packed RBCs for a\\nhemtocrit of 27.6. The Acute Pain Service continued to follow\\nthe patient for management of the epidural catheter. He was\\nadmitted to the CSRU for a day after surgery and was transferred\\nto the floor on [**7-26**] after he was deemed to be stable. His chest\\ntubes were placed to water seal, and a chest radiograph showed\\nvery slight increase in left pneomothorax.\\n\\nOn [**7-27**], his anterior chest tube which was placed\\nintraoperatively was removed without incident, and his second\\ntube was put to bulb suction. A chest radiograph that was done\\nafter these changes were made showed no acute or concerning\\nchanges in the left pneumothorax. His epidural catheter was\\nremoved and he was given oral pain medications.\\n\\nOn [**7-28**], the patient's foley catheter was discontinued, but the\\npatient failed to void 12 hours after removal. He was\\nadministered tamsulosin and his foley catheter was replaced. A\\nPA and lateral chest radiograph showed decreased left-sided\\npneumothorax and interstitial edema since the prior examination,\\nwith small bilateral pleural effusions.\\n\\nOn [**2183-7-29**], he underwent a video swallow study which revealed a\\nleft vocal cord paralysis. The speech consultant recommended the\\nfollowing:\\n1.  Diet of thin liquids and soft solids\\n2. Swallow w/chin tucked to chest for all consistencies\\n3.  Pills whole in applesauce\\n4.  ENT consult to evaluate vocal cord mobility to r/o Left\\n    vocal cord paresis/paralysis\\n\\nAn otolaryngology consult was obtained for evaluation and\\ntreatment for this condition, the recommendation which were to\\nobserve strict chin-tuck adherence and strict aspiration\\nprecautions as the patient was thought to be at great aspiration\\nrisk; and twice-daily proton pump inhibitor. A chest radiograph\\nperformed on [**2183-7-29**] showed further improvement in the small\\nleft apical pneumothorax and improvement in the interstitial\\nedema.\\n\\nOn [**2183-7-30**], he underwent another voiding trial after his foley\\nwas discontinued, and this time, he voided 500cc.

In the ED she was found to be have 02\\nsat of 84% on RA was given 4L in NC 02 sat increased to 96%.\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nMs. [**Known lastname 1146**] was initially treated for a COPD exacerbation, which\\nwas felt to be the primary contributor to her SOB especially\\ngiven that she wasn't on any inhalers at home despite an FEV1 of\\n25% predicted in [**2095**].  She was also ruled out for MI.  Her\\ncreatinine initially trended down with gentle hydration.  On the\\nevening of [**2108-2-18**], she was found to be in Afib w/RVR to the\\n150s.  She was given metoprolol 5 mg IV x3 and diltiazem x 1\\ndose without successful slowing.  She became more tachypneic and\\nshort of breath, and hypotensive to the 70s.  She was intubated,\\ncardioverted to NSR w/100 Jx1, and started on dopamine.  She was\\ntransferred to the CCU.  Overnight, she went back into afib\\nw/RVR and required cardioversion twice (second time successful\\nat 200J).  She was only in NSR for a short time, and again went\\nback into afib.   She was bolused w/amiodarone 150 mg and begun\\non an amio infusion at 1 mg/min.  Cardioversion was again\\nbriefly successful but she ultimately went back into afib.  Her\\ndopamine was weaned off on [**2-19**].  Her rhythm was in and out of\\nafib but eventually converted to sinus with the amio infusion.\\nShe had a TTE which revealed an EF 30-35%, repeat CXR c/w\\nworsening failure, and diuresis was attempted with a lasix gtt.\\nHer vent was changed from AC to PS but she became progressively\\nacidemic (ABG from 7.42/42/92 to 7.21/56/66).  Her creatinine\\nbegan to increase with the attempt at diuresis, from 1.0 to 1.5.\\n At this point she also developed a cold/purple R foot, and a\\nheparin gtt was started.  This resolved the problem.  Vascular\\nsurgery evaluated the pt and agreed with this treatment.\\nBecause of her severe COPD, it was felt that it would be very\\ndifficult to wean her from the vent.  At that point, there was a\\ndiscussion between the PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1147**] and the family, who\\nfelt it was best to extubate her and keep her comfortable.  She\\nwas then extubated at that time and given morphine for comfort.\\nShe died at 3:15 pm on [**2108-2-22**] with her family by her side.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\n1.

Hypotension - Likely secondary to medications given (morphine\\ninitially then versed in the setting of intubation). Unlikely to\\nbe secondary to septic shock given that he was not initially\\nhypotensive and only was hypotensive in the setting of lots of\\nmorphine and then lots of versed. however, septic shock is\\npossible given large PNA and UTI. Doubt cardiac etiology for\\nhypotension. In MICU continued to be hypotensive requiring\\npressors-levophed. Not thought to be septic shock micro data was\\nnegative throughout his hospitalization. He was fluid\\nresusitated however remained on pressors until [**2-23**], he was\\nstarted on Hydrocort/fludrocort on [**2-21**] for adrenal\\ninsufficiency. His BP remained stable off pressors and will\\ncontinue Hydrocort/fludrocort for a 7 day course which will end\\non [**2-27**].\\n.\\n2.
