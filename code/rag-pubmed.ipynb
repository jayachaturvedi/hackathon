The cohort was divided into the transient risk, unprovoked, continued cancer treatment, and cancer remission groups. The following were compared between DOACs and warfarin: composite outcome of all-cause death, VTE recurrence, bleeding and composite outcome of VTE-related death, recurrence and bleeding. In the continued cancer treatment group, more bleeding was seen in warfarin-treated patients than in patients treated with DOACs (53.2% vs. 31.2%, [P=0.048]). In addition, composite outcome of VTE-related death and recurrence after discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy (n=369) was evaluated. The continued cancer treatment group (multivariate analysis: HR: 3.62, 95% CI: 1.84-7.12, P<0.005) and bleeding-related discontinuation of therapy (HR: 2.60, 95% CI: 1.32-5.13, P=0.006) were independent predictors of the event after discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy. VTE recurrence after discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy in the cancer remission group was 1.6% and a statistically similar occurrence was found in the transient risk group (12.4%) (P=0.754).\\nCONCLUSIONS: DOACs may decrease bleeding incidence in patients continuing to receive cancer treatment. In patients with bleeding-related discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy, VTE recurrence may increase. Discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy might be a treatment option in patients who have completed their cancer treatment.\",\n          \"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest clinically significant ECG-evidenced sustained cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice. Disability and mortality attributed to AF is high in low-income regions like sub-Saharan Africa. The risk of stroke/TIA in patients with AF can be significantly reduced with anti-thrombotic therapy. Despite the existing evidence of its benefit, significant percentages of AF patients eligible for anti-thrombotic therapy are undertreated in the region.\\nMETHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the appropriate use of anti-thrombotic therapy in patients with AF between December 1, 2018 and September 30, 2019 at Cardiac Clinic, University of Gondar hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. Consecutive sampling method was used to recruit 210 study subjects. Patients were interviewed to obtain socio-demographic data. Relevant medical history and laboratory parameters were obtained from patients' records. Diagnosis of atrial fibrillation was based on detection of irregular arterial pulse and presence of 'f' waves on 12-lead ECG tracing. Clinical evaluation, echocardiography, chest X-ray and blood chemistry were used to diagnose underlying causes of AF. Data was entered into EPI Info version 4.4.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Bi-variate and multi-variate logistic regression analyses were used to identify associated factors with appropriate use of anti-thrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation. P-values <\\u20090.05 were used to declare significant association.\\nRESULTS: A total of 210 patients were included in the study. The mean age of patients was 51.29\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200917.2\\u2009years. Two-thirds (145/210) of participants were females. Seventy-four (35%) had valvular AF, while 136/210 (65%) had non-valvular AF. Sixty-six percent (139/210) of study subjects were appropriately treated with anti-thrombotic therapy. Appropriately treated subjects in valvular AF group and non-valvular AF group were 58/74 (78%) and 81/136 (60%) respectively. On multi-variate analysis, 'can afford for regular INR monitoring' (AOR\\u2009=\\u20092.60 95% CI: 1.10-6.10, P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) was significantly associated with appropriate use of anti-thrombotic therapy.\\nCONCLUSION: Sixty-six percent of AF patients eligible for anti-thrombotic therapy were appropriately treated. Intervention program to access 'regular INR monitoring' should be practiced to escalate utilization rate of anti-thrombotic therapy (warfarin) in eligible AF patients.\",\n          \"INTRODUCTION: Myocardial bridging (MB) is a common and usually benign inborn coronary abnormality that may lead to anginal symptoms, acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias, and rarely sudden cardiac death. MB are most commonly localized in the middle segment of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The treatment of LAD-MB is still challenging. Our objective was to assess the short- and long-term results of surgical procedures in patients with LAD-MB who had chest pain refractory to medical therapy.\\nMETHODS: Between March 2005 and January 2020, 26 patients (19 males and 7 females; mean 55.8\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200912.4 years) with MB underwent surgery. All MB was located in the mid-segment of the LAD with a mean length of 4.2\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091.7\\u2009cm. Coronary angiography before surgery demonstrated LAD-MB with systolic compression more than or equal to 70% in all patients.\\nRESULTS: Twenty-five patients underwent myotomy and one patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). All patients survived and recovered uneventfully. Neither hospital or late death nor major complications occurred. Follow-up time was 3-173 months (mean 55.7 months). Follow-up of coronary angiography or computed tomography scan performed in 16 patients demonstrated restoration of coronary blood flow and myocardial perfusion without significant residual compression of the artery. All patients were symptom-free and are currently in NYHA Class I.\\nCONCLUSION: The symptomatic LAD-MB patients who are refractory to medication should actively undergo the surgical intervention such as myotomy and CABG to eliminate the clinical symptoms and achieve satisfactory results by follow-up findings. Myotomy is a preferred procedure because of its safety and satisfactory results.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"combined\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9982,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Questionable necessity of nitroglycerin for diagnostic coronary artery examination using 320-row multi-detector computed tomography. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze and compare the diagnostic effectiveness of 320-row multi-detector computed tomography for coronary artery angiography (MDCTA) in subjects with and without sublingual vasodilator (nitroglycerin).\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: From September 2015 to September 2016, 70 individuals without history of major cardiovascular diseases who underwent MDCTA for health examination were retrospectively categorized into sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG) and non-NTG groups. Medical history, CT dose index (CTDI), and multi-slice CT images were compared between two groups. A diameter of coronary artery (DA, mm) was computed and analyzed.\\nRESULTS: A total of 41 males and 29 females (mean age: 55.43\\u00b18.84 years, range: 34- 76) were reviewed. Normal and abnormal MDCTA findings were noted in 54 and 16 participants, respectively, with the detection rate of coronary artery disease being 23%. There was no significant difference in inter-observer variability of coronary CTA image quality and diagnosis between the NTG and non-NTG groups among three experienced radiologists. Although the percentage dilatation of left anterior descending branch (LAD), right coronary artery (RCA) and left circumflex branch (LCX) following in the NTG group were 12.4%, 12.8% and 25.3%, respectively (p\\u200a<\\u200a0.01), there was no significant difference in image quality and diagnosis between the two groups.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite the recommendation of routine nitroglycerin use for subjects undergoing computed tomography for coronary artery angiography, our results showed no significant advantage of its use in improving image quality and rate of diagnosis accuracy.

A 41-year-old woman experienced back pain upon waking up. Immediately afterward, she experienced a continual orthostatic headache. Thereafter, right ear fullness and dizziness also occurred. One month later, she became aware of repeated numbness that started in the right hand and spread to the right half of the body and lower limbs and continued for repeated periods of approximately 20-30\\u2005min. Neurological examination revealed no abnormal findings except for orthostatic headache. Electroencephalography showed no epileptic discharge. Head MRI revealed left convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH) restricted to the prefrontal sulcus, left frontal cerebral venous thrombosis, diffuse dural thickening with gadolinium enhancement, and subdural hematoma in the posterior cranial fossa. Spinal MRI revealed epidural fluid accumulation around the thoracic spine. CT myelography revealed cerebrospinal fluid leakages at the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae levels. The patient was diagnosed with spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), which was treated effectively with a blood patch. In this case, cSAH may have resulted from rupturing of the vessel wall as a result of cortical venous thrombosis induced by SIH. The repeated transient neurologic symptoms suggesting migraine aura may have originated from cSAH, which in turn led to cortical spreading depression. The diagnosis and management of SIH can be often difficult; therefore, repeated migraine-aura-like symptoms are a critical sign of complication with cSAH and cortical venous thrombosis.

INTRODUCTION: The optimal choice of oral P2Y<inf>12</inf> receptor inhibitors has the potential to significantly influence outcomes. We seek to compare the safety and efficacy of the three most commonly used oral P2Y<inf>12</inf> receptor inhibitors (clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor) in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) via a comprehensive systematic review and network meta-analysis.\\nEVIDENCE ACQUISITION: In line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines, we performed a comprehensive search for RCTs which compared cardiovascular and hemorrhagic outcomes after use of at least two of the distinct oral P2Y<inf>12</inf> receptor inhibitors (i.e. clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor). A search strategy has been designed to systematically search multiple databases, including MEDLINE with PubMed interface, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase. In addition, key inclusion criteria will be trial size of at least 100 patients and at least 1 month of follow-up time. Several prespecified subgroups will be explored, including Asian patients, patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, patients of advanced age, and others.\\nEVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Exploratory frequentist pairwise meta-analyses will be based primarily on a random-effects method, relying on relative risks (RR) for short-term outcomes and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for long-term outcomes. Inferential frequentist network meta-analysis will be based primarily on a random-effects method, relying on RR and IRR as specified above. Results will be reported as point summary of effect, 95% CI, and P values for effect, and graphically represented using forest plots.\\nCONCLUSIONS: An international collaborative network meta-analysis has begun to comprehensively analyze the safety and efficacy of prasugrel, ticagrelor and clopidogrel, each on a background of aspirin, for management of patients with ACS. It is our hope that the rigor and breadth of the undertaking described herein will provide novel insights that will inform optimal patient care for patients with ACS treated conservatively, or undergoing revascularization.

Between January 15 and February 25, 2020, data for all cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempts for IHCA that occurred in a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, China were collected according to the Utstein style. The primary outcome was restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and the secondary outcomes were 30-day survival, and neurological outcome.\\nRESULTS: Data from 136 patients showed 119 (87.5%) patients had a respiratory cause for their cardiac arrest, and 113 (83.1%) were resuscitated in a general ward. The initial rhythm was asystole in 89.7%, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) in 4.4%, and shockable in 5.9%. Most patients with IHCA were monitored (93.4%) and in most resuscitation (89%) was initiated <1\\u202fmin. The average length of hospital stay was 7 days and the time from illness onset to hospital admission was 10 days.

With the limited effectiveness, currently available virus-directed therapies may have a substantial impact on global health due to continued reports of mutant variants affecting repeated waves of COVID-19 around the world.\n","METHODS: We searched articles pertaining to aspirin, COVID-19, acute lung injury and pharmacology in PubMed and provide a comprehensive appraisal of potential use of aspirin in the management of patients with COVID-19. The scope of this article is to provide an overview of the rationale and currently available clinical evidence that supports aspirin as an effective therapeutic option in COVID-19.\n","RESULTS: Experimental and clinical evidence are available for the potential use of aspirin in patients with COVID-19.\n","\n","Pulmonary hypertension is a pathophysiologic manifestation of a heterogeneous group of diseases, with the main pathophysiologic mechanisms being persistent pulmonary vasoconstriction and irreversible vascular remodeling. The impact significantly affects the prognosis of patients with pulmonary hypertension. If it is not treated and intervened in time, it may lead to right ventricular failure and further endanger the patient's life. Within the past decade or so, nebulized inhalation therapy is considered to have advantages in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension as a safe, limited, and rapid therapy, for example, inhaled vasodilators (prostate analogs, nitroglycerin, carbon monoxide analogs sildenafil, and nitroprusside), inhaled anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative agents (simvastatin, and selatinib), and inhaled peroxides (levocetirizine) have been recognized as emerging therapeutic approaches in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension as emerging therapeutic approaches.\n","\n","RESULTS: At 12 months, comparison of BoPH levels between the predominant THS use and cigarette smoking groups showed a positive effect in favor of switching, partially or in full, to THS.\n","CONCLUSION: These results provide additional evidence of the harm reduction potential of THS for smokers who would otherwise continue smoking, but they need to be verified in long-term confirmatory studies.\n","CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT0264955.

However, several studies have suggested that some patients show an atypical presentation at the onset: symptoms lacking sudden headache and diminished consciousness. These atypical symptoms can easily lead to misdiagnosis. This paper reported the death cases of acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage with toothache as the first symptom, hoping to provide clinical evidence for the general public doctors to reduce the misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis of SAH, improve the identification ability of SAH, and prevent such death events from happening again.\n","\n","Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with arterial or venous thrombosis or pregnancy complications.

NK was found to be ineffective in lowering lipids and suppressing atherosclerosis progression at a dose of 3,600 FU/day. The lipid-lowering effect of NK was more prominent in subjects who smoked, drank alcohol, and subjects with higher BMI. Regular exercise further improved the effects of NK. Co-administration of vitamin K2 and aspirin with NK produced a synergetic effect. No noticeable adverse effects associated with the use of NK were recorded. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that atherosclerosis progression and hyperlipidemia can be effectively managed with NK at a dose of 10,800 FU/day. The lower dose of 3,600 FU per day is ineffective. The dose of 10,800 FU/day is safe and well tolerated. Some lifestyle factors and the coadministration of vitamin K2 and aspirin lead to improved outcomes in the use of NK.
